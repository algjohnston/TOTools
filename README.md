Sprint 3 Changes:

    Added GraphQL.Client and used it to get data from start.gg
    based on a url provided by the user! |っ^ᴥ^ꐦ|っ

    Added logic to make a schedule of matches in a way that will 
    try to prevent players from having to wait.

    Added logic to estimate match lengths.

    The match list now supports match reordering! ~(ȍ‿ȍ~)

    Had to remove StrawberryShake due to a very naive bug 
    where they assumed the id was always a string despite the 
    GraphQL spec saying it can be an int. |¬ᗒ□ᗕ|¬
